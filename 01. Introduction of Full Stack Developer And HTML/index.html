HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS ?

A website works on 3 Parts.

1. Client  -> Anyone who requests the website ( youtube.com  , facebook.com etc ) to the Server through Browser.
2. Browser -> A Browser requests the server which is given by the Client and recieves the code from the server
              if it is ( 200 ok response ), then browser Displays the Content by coverting the code,
              very rarely if the it is not ok 200 response, the it throws an error like error 404, server down etc. 
3. Server  -> Server is a who recives the request from the browser and provides the code to the browser.
